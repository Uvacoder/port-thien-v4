# React Hooks

## What are hooks?

his new feature was added in React version 16.8. With the help of React Hooks, you can write the React features without using the classes. React hooks allow you to write less code and that makes your app efficient, simpler, and powerful.

5 most common hooks are:

- useState: Most of the time in your React app you will be using this concept to store and manage the data.
- useEffect: You will be using this concept in actions like HTTP requests and working with the Browser API.
- useRef: This will be used to reference JSX elements.
- useContext: This property of React Hooks will be used to access data from React Context to share data among components easily (instead of passing props)
- useReducer: This concept in React hooks will be used to store and manage data across multiple components.
